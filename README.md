# COMP-479-Final-Project
The purpose of this project is to build and train a classification model to predict patient diagnosis of cervical cancer.

Note: Upon further reading, we understand that there are better metrics for evaluating models that predict cancer diagnosis. This is something we will implement in future projects.
